        \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

        Following the success of Bitcoin, many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been developed and deployed.
        To meet different requirements in various scenarios, a great number of heterogeneous blockchains have emerged.
        However, most present blockchain platforms are isolated systems.
        Therefore, interoperability between blockchains become one of the key issues
        that prevent the blockchain technology from wide adoption.

        \subsection{Existing Solutions}\label{subsec:existing-solutions}

        \subsubsection{Centralized Solutions}\label{subsubsec:centralized-solutions}

        A classical solution to cross-chain interoperability is a trusted oracle that registers some event on one blockchain and performs the required action on the other.
        Centralized oracles provide fast and cheap transactions but lack a key feature, decentralization.
        The liquidity of a protocol built on this approach is custodial, which is a centralized approach similar to CeFi when users deposit their funds to an exchange's wallet:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A system is not sustainable when it depends on a single party
            \item If the oracle goes down unfinished swaps can appear frozen halfway
            \item A centralized oracle can censor transactions
            \item A malicious oracle can perform a man-in-the-middle attack by sending inaccurate data.
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Semi-Centralized Solutions}\label{subsubsec:semi-centralized-solutions}

        Another common approach involves intermediate network consisting of fixed number of hand-picked oracles facilitating the transfer of data among multiple blockchains.
        PoA or PoS consensus is used with high collateral and a small (less than a hundred) number of nodes.
        Often, all funds transferred between blockchains are stored on some kind of threshold wallets, which are generated by the participants of the intermediate network, thus they are controlled by a fixed group of oracle operators.
        This method is inherently similar to the first one, although it is slightly more decentralized.

        \section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}

        The resulted system should have the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Decentralization.} The system should be decentralized.
            \item \textbf{Interoperability.} The system should be able to support a large number of heterogeneous blockchains.
            \item \textbf{Openness.} The system should allow anyone to participate in consensus permissionlessly.
            \item \textbf{Consensus Scalability.} The system should be able to operate normally while maintaining sufficiently large consensus groups.
            \item \textbf{Operational Scalability.} The system should scale linearly relating to the number of supported blockchains.
            \item \textbf{Security.} The system should be able to withstand Sybil attacks.
            \item \textbf{Sustainability.} The system should be able to tolerate faults of the connected blockchains.
            \item \textbf{Upgradability.} The system should allow adding new chains over time.
        \end{enumerate}

        \section{Applications}\label{sec:applications}

        \subsection{Decentralized Cross-Chain Oracle}\label{subsec:cross-chain-oracle}
        In oracle mode of operation the system is capable of providing a notarized set of events observed on supported blockchains.
        Cross-Chain Oracle is a simple yet solving the cross-chain interoperability solution.

        \subsection{Custodial Asset Management}\label{subsec:custodial-asset-management}
        In custodial mode of operation the system is capable of managing user assets which are stored on corresponding blockchains in \emph{vaults}.
        Each vault stores epoch number $n$, an aggregated public key $aPK_n$ of the current validator set $V_n$ and
        is guarded with a script (smart-contract) capable of performing verification of
        an aggregated signature ${verify: (\sigma_n, m_n, aPK_n) \rightarrow 0 | 1}$.

        \paragraph{Natively Cross-Chain Applications}
        Decentralized custodial management in conjunction with a computational layer can be highly beneficial for expanding the capabilities of the system.
        Moving beyond simple bridges to what we call \emph{Natively Cross-Chain Applications} (NCCAs).
        NCCAs are applications that are deployed in cross-chain network and are capable of interacting with other blockchains without the need of external oracles or bridges.
