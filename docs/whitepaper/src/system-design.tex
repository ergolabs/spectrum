This section presents Spectrum protocol design starting from a naive approach based on PBFT and gradually\
addressing the challenges.

\subsection{Strawman Design: PBFTNetwork}\label{subsec:strawman-design}

For simplicity we begin with a notarization protocol based on PBFT, then iteratively refine it into Spectrum.

PBFTNetwork assumes that a group of ${n = 3f + 1}$ trusted nodes has been pre-selected upfront and fixed and at most\
$f$ of these nodes are byzantine.
At any given time one of these nodes is the \emph{leader}, who observes events on connected blockchains,
batch them and initiate round of notarization within the consensus group.
Remaining members of the consensus group verify the proposed batches by checking the presence of updates on\
corresponding blockchains.
Upon successful verification each node signs the batch with its secret key and sends the signature to the leader.

Under simplifying assumptions that at most $f$ nodes are byzantine the PBFTNetwork guarantees livness and safety.
However, the assumption of a fixed trusted committee is not realistic for open decentralized systems.
Moreover, as PBFT consensus members authenticate each other via non-transferable symmetric-key MACs, each consensus
member has to communicate with others directly, what results in $O(n^2)$ communication complexity.
Quadratic communication complexity imposes a hard limit on scalability of the system.
Such a design also scales poorly in terms of adding support for more chains.
The workload of each validator grows linearly with each added chain.

In the subsequent sections we address these limitations in four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opening consensus group and leaders.} We introduce a lottery-based mechanism for selecting consensus\
    group and leaders dynamically.
    \item \textbf{Replacing MACs by Digital Signatures.} We replace MACs by digital signatures to make authentication\
    transferable and thus opening the door for sparser communication patterns that can help to reduce\
    the communication complexity.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Collective Signature Aggregation.} We utilize Byzantine-tolerant aggregation\
    protocol that allows for quick aggregation of cryptographic signatures to reduce communication complexity\
    to $O(\log n)$.
    \item \textbf{Eliminating Validator Bottleneck.} We shard consensus groups into units by the type of chain\
    each node is able to handle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Flow}\label{subsec:protocol-flow}
let's summarize all of the above and describe the full flow of the Spectrum protocol.
Protocol is running by manually selected opening consensus group $V_0$.
Stakeholders interact with each other and with the ideal functionalities ${\mathcal_{F}}_{RLB}$,\
${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$, ${\mathcal_{F}}_{KES}$, ${\mathcal_{F}}_{DSIG}$ over a sequence of $L = E \cdot R$ slots\
${S=\{sl_1,...,sl_L\}}$ consisting of $E$ epochs with $R$ slots each.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}\label{subsubsec:bootstrapping}

The system is bootstrapped in a trusted way.
A manually picked set of validators $V_0$ of the predefined size $M$ is assigned to the first epoch $e_0$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item On-chain vaults are initialized with an aggregated public key $aPK_0$ of the initial committee.

    \item All consensus group members i.e. $\forall PK_i \in V_0$ should generate the tuple of verification keys\
    ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$, using the ideal functionalities ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$,\
    ${\mathcal_{F}}_{KES}$, ${\mathcal_{F}}_{DSIG}$ instances, running on their machines.

    \item Then, to claim an initial stakes $\{s_i\}_{i=0}^M$ every protocol participant sends a request\
    ${(\textbf{ver\_keys}, sid, PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$ to the ${\mathcal_{F}}_{RLB}$,\
    which saves the key tuple ${(PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$.

    \item Full set of the verification\
    keys tuples ${V_{init} = \{(PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})\}_{i=0}^M}$\
    should be stored in the blockchain and acknowledged by all members of the initial consensus group.

    \item ${\mathcal_{F}}_{RLB}$, parameterized with confirmed $V_{init}$ is evaluated independently by every\
    participant to sample an initial random seed value $\eta \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$.

    \item Finally, all approved stakeholders should agree on the genesis block\
    ${B_0=\left(\{(PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig}, s_i)\}_{i=0}^M, \eta\right)}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Normal Flow}\label{subsubsec:normal-flow}
Once the system is bootstrapped, protocol is running in a normal flow.
\begin{enumerate}[listparindent=0.5cm,
    align=left]
    \item \textbf{Registration}.
    Any Spectrum stakeholder can register to become a committee member.
    To get a chance to be included in the set of validators $V_n$ in the epoch $e_n$ participant $PK_i$ should register\
    in the lottery during the epoch $e_{n-2}$ by publishing his verification tuples\
    ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$.

    \item \textbf{Consensus Lottery}.
    At the end of the epoch ${e_j \geqslant 1}$ every verified $PK_i$ sends\
    ${(\textbf{epochrnd\_req}, sid, PK_i, e_j)}$ to ${\mathcal_{F}}_{RLB}$ and receives\
    $({\textbf{epochrnd}, sid, \eta_j)}$.
    When every $PK_i$ evaluates ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ with a query\
    ${(\textbf{EvalProve}, sid, \eta_j || e_j || \textbf{test*})}$\
    and pass the received random $y$ value to the ${\mathcal_{F}}_{L}$.
    If successful, then publish $y$ and the associated proof to form an approved consensus\
    group members table for the epoch ${e_{j + 1}}$.

    \item \textbf{Committee key aggregation}.
    Once new committee is selected, nodes in $V_n$ aggregate their individual public keys $\{PK_i\}$ into
    a joint one $aPK_n$.

    \item \textbf{Committee transition}.
    Nodes in $V_{n-1}$ publish cross-chain message ${M_n : (aPK_n, \sigma_{n-1})}$ , where $aPK_n$ is
    an aggregated public key of the new committee $V_n$ , $\sigma_{n-1}$ is an aggregated signature of
    $M_n$ such that ${Verify(\sigma_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1}, Mn) = 1}$.
    Vaults are updated such that ${Vault\{(E_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1})\} \coloneqq (e_n, aPK_n)}$.

    \item \textbf{Chain extension}.
    Every online consensus group member collects en existed chains and verifying that for every chain every block,\
    produced up to $Z$ blocks before contains correct data about slot $sl'$ leader $PK'$.
    To verify a valid slot leader, response from the ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ to query\
    ${(\textbf{Verify}, sid, \eta' || sl' || \textbf{test}, y', \pi', v^{vrf'})}$ should be\
    ${(\textbf{Verified}, sid, \eta' || sl' || \textbf{test}, y', \pi', 1)}$ and $y'<T_j'$ as well.
    String \textbf{test} is an arbitrary and value $T_j'$ is a threshold for the stakeholder $PK'$ for the slot $sl'$.

    Then every lottery participant separately evaluates ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ with his own inputs\
    ${(\textbf{EvalProve}, sid, \eta_j || sl || \textbf{nonce})}$ and\
    ${(\textbf{EvalProve}, sid, \eta_j || sl || \textbf{test})}$, where \textbf{nonce} is an arbitrary string.
    Received outputs ${(\textbf{Evaluated}, sid, y, \pi)}$ and ${(\textbf{Evaluated}, sid, \rho_y, \rho_\pi)}$\
    respectively includes generated random numbers ${y, \rho_y}$ and the associated proofs ${\pi, \rho_\pi}$.
    If ${y < T_i^j}$ then $PK_i$ is a slot leader and he can propose a batch which should be notarized by all\
    committee members.
    Random number $\rho_y$ will be used to sample a random seed for the next epoch.

    \textbf{Note:} The ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ is designed in such a way that not every slot has a leader,\
    moreover, most of the slots remain empty to serve protocol synchronization.
    If there are $P$ several elected leaders for this slot, they all propose a new batches of updates\
    $\{B_p\}_{p=0}^P$ with included proofs of the leadership ${(v_i^{vrf}, y, \pi)}$ and ${(\pi, \rho_\pi)}$.

    After notarization batch is shared with over committees via syncing shards mechanism.
    After syncing any of the separate committee leaders can propose a block consisted of notarized batches and sign\
    it with ${\mathcal_{F}}_{KES}$ by sending the request ${(\textbf{sign\_req}, sid, PK_i, B_p, sl)}$.
    Received from ${\mathcal_{F}}_{KES}$ response signature $\sigma_p$ is included in the proposed block.

\end{enumerate}
