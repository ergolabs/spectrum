This section presents Spectrum protocol design starting from a naive approach based on\
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)~\cite{Castro2001} and gradually addressing the challenges.

\subsection{Strawman Design: PBFTNetwork}\label{subsec:strawman-design}

For simplicity we begin with a notarization protocol based on PBFT\
and then iteratively refine it into the Spectrum protocol.

PBFTNetwork assumes that a fixed consensus group of ${n = 3f + 1}$ nodes has been pre-selected upfront\
and at most $f$ of these nodes are Byzantine.
The PBFT protocol is designed in such a way that there is no need to trust each individual notary,\
but only two-thirds of the set.
This approach has proved its reliability in practice and has been widely used in various\
blockchain protocols for many years.

At any given moment of time, one of the nodes is the leader who observes the events on the connected blockchains,\
batch them and initiate a notarization round within the consensus group.
All validators verify the proposed batch by checking for relevant updates on the connected chains.
Upon successful verification each node signs the batch with a secret key and sends the signature to the leader.

Liveness and safety of the PBFTNetwork is guaranteed under the simplifying assumptions already mentioned above\
that at most $f$ nodes are Byzantine.
However, the assumption of a fixed trusted committee is unrealistic for open decentralized systems.
Moreover, as PBFT consensus members authenticate each other via non-transferable symmetric-key MACs, each consensus\
member has to communicate with others directly, what results in the $O(n^2)$ communication complexity.
Quadratic communication complexity imposes a hard limit on the scalability of the system.
Such a design is not suitable for building a multi-chain system, since the workload of\
each validator grows linearly with each added chain.

In the subsequent sections, we address these limitations in four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opening the Consensus Group.} We introduce a lottery-based mechanism to \emph{select the consensus\
        group dynamically}.
    \item \textbf{Replacing MACs by Digital Signatures.} We replace MACs by digital signatures to make authentication\
    transferable and thus opening the door for \emph{sparser communication patterns} that can help reduce\
    communication complexity.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Collective Signature Aggregation.} We utilize Byzantine-tolerant aggregation\
    protocol that allows for \emph{quick aggregation of cryptographic signatures} and reduces communication complexity\
    to $O(\log{n})$.
    \item \textbf{Eliminating Validator Bottleneck.} We shard consensus groups into local committees\
    by the type of chain that each node is able to handle to \emph{improve system scalability}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Replacing MACs by Digital Signatures}\label{subsec:replacing-macs-by-digital-signatures}

The main issue with MACs is that any node capable of validating MAC is also capable of generating new messages with\
valid MACs as the secret key used for MAC generation is also necessary for validation.
Digital signatures, on the other\
hand, use asymmetric protocols for signature generation and signature verification powered by public-key cryptography.
A valid secure digital signature for the message can only be generated with the knowledge of the secret key\
(non-forgery requirement), and verified with the corresponding public key (correctness requirement), and the secret\
key never leaves the signer's node.
The authenticity of the message from the network node can be verified by any party\
knowing the node public key.
Moreover, given the full history of communication, the malicious actor is still not able to\
forge the new message with valid signature of the node.
This gives a way finer control over the set of permissions and\
provides a strong authentication method.

Spectrum utilizes the specific subset of signatures based on so-called sigma-protocols.
The benefits of these protocols\
are numerous, including the possibility of proving complex logical statements inside the scheme, provable\
zero-knowledge, and use of standardized and well-established crypto-primitives, namely conventional cryptographic hash\
functions and standard elliptic curves with hard discrete logarithm problem.
This means the high level of support in the\
existing chains without modification of the core opcodes or writing supplementary on-chain routines.
