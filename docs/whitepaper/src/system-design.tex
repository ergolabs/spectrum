This section presents Spectrum protocol design starting from a naive approach based on\
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)~\cite{Castro2001} and gradually addressing the challenges.

\subsection{Strawman Design: PBFTNetwork}\label{subsec:strawman-design}

For simplicity we begin with a notarization protocol based on PBFT, then iteratively refine it into Spectrum.

PBFTNetwork assumes that a fixed consensus group of ${n = 3f + 1}$ nodes has been pre-selected upfront,\
and at most $f$ of these nodes are Byzantine.
The PBFT protocol is designed in such a way that there no no need to trust every individual notary,\
but only two-thirds of the set.
This approach has proved its reliability in practice and has been widely used in various solutions for many years.

At any given time one of these nodes is the leader, who observes events on the connected blockchains,\
batch them and initiate a notarization round within the consensus group.
All validators verify the proposed batch by checking for relevant updates on the connected chains.
Upon successful verification each node signs the batch with a secret key and sends the signature to the leader.

Liveness and safety of the PBFTNetwork is guaranteed under the simplifying assumptions already mentioned above,\
that at most $f$ nodes are Byzantine.
However, the assumption of a fixed trusted committee is not realistic for open decentralized systems.
Moreover, as PBFT consensus members authenticate each other via non-transferable symmetric-key MACs, each consensus\
member has to communicate with others directly, what results in the $O(n^2)$ communication complexity.
Quadratic communication complexity imposes a hard limit on scalability of the system.
Such a design is not suitable for building a multi-chain system, since the workload of\
each validator grows linearly with each added chain.

In the subsequent sections we address these limitations in four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opening consensus group.} We introduce a fair lottery-based mechanism to select consensus\
    group dynamically.
    \item \textbf{Replacing MACs by Digital Signatures.} We replace MACs by digital signatures to make authentication\
    transferable and, thus, opening the door for sparser communication patterns that reduces\
    the communication complexity.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Collective Signature Aggregation.} We utilize Byzantine-tolerant aggregation\
    protocol that allows for quick aggregation of cryptographic signatures and reduces communication complexity\
    to $O(\log n)$.
    \item \textbf{Eliminating Validator Bottleneck.} We shard consensus groups into local committees\
    by the type of chain that each node is able to handle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Flow}\label{subsec:protocol-flow}
let's summarize all of the above and describe the full flow of the Spectrum protocol.
Protocol is running by manually selected opening consensus group $V_0$.
Stakeholders interact with each other and with the ideal functionalities ${\mathcal{F}}_{RLB}$,\
${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$, ${\mathcal{F}}_{KES}$, ${\mathcal{F}}_{DSIG}$ over a sequence of $L = E \cdot R$ slots\
${S=\{sl_1,...,sl_L\}}$ consisting of $E$ epochs with $R$ slots each.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}\label{subsubsec:bootstrapping}

The system is bootstrapped in a trusted way.
A manually picked set of validators $V_0$ of the predefined size $M$ is assigned to the first epoch $e_0$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item On-chain vaults are initialized with an aggregated public key $aPK_0$ of the initial committee.

    \item All consensus group members i.e. $\forall PK_i \in V_0$ should generate the tuple of verification keys\
    ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$, using the ideal functionalities ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$,\
    ${\mathcal{F}}_{KES}$, ${\mathcal{F}}_{DSIG}$ instances, running on their machines.

    \item Full set of the verification\
    keys tuples ${V_{init} = \{(PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})\}_{i=0}^M}$ with the initial stakes $\{s_i\}_{i=0}^M$
    must be stored in the blockchain and acknowledged by all members of the initial consensus group.

    \item ${\mathcal{F}}_{LB}$, parameterized with confirmed $V_{init}$ is evaluated independently by every\
    participant to sample an initial random seed value $\eta \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$.

    \item Finally, all approved stakeholders should agree on the genesis block\
    ${B_0=\left(\{(PK_i, v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig}, s_i)\}_{i=0}^M, \eta\right)}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Normal Flow}\label{subsubsec:normal-flow}
Once the system is bootstrapped, protocol is running in a normal flow:
\begin{legal}
    \item \textbf{Registration}.
    Any Spectrum stakeholder can register to become a committee member of his local chain $c_i$.
    To get a chance to be included in the set of validators $\mathbf{C}^n_i$ in the epoch $e_n$\
    participant $PK_i$ should register in the lottery during the epoch $e_{n-2}$ by publishing his verification tuple\
    ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$ into the $L^+$.
    Once enough time (number of slots) has elapsed to meet the reliable confirmation threshold $R^+$ for the $L^+$,\
    the participant is considered as \textit{verified}.

    \item \textbf{Consensus Lottery}.
    At the end of the epoch ${e_j \geq 1}$ every \textit{verified} $PK_i$ receives new epoch seed $\eta_n$\
    from the ${\mathcal{F}}_{LB}$.
    When every $PK_i$ evaluates ${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$ with the input, which includes new $\eta_n$\
    and passes the received proof $\pi_i$ to the ${\mathcal{F}}_{L}$.
    Function ${\mathcal{F}}_{L}$ is parameterized with the $\mathbf{C}^i$ lottery params and uses the same\
    stake distribution which was in the last block used by ${\mathcal{F}}_{LB}$ to calculate the threshold.
    If successful, i.e. ${\mathcal{F}}_{L}$ returns $1$, then publish the associated proofs into the $L^+$.
    Functionality ${\mathcal{F}}_{LB}$ is parameterized with the history, including blocks with release times up to\
    ${-R^+}$ from the actual slot.
    Therefore, even in case of a rollback, the currently selected members of the consensus group remain legitimate

    \item \textbf{Committee key aggregation}.
    Once new committee is selected, nodes in the $\mathbf{C}_i^n$ aggregate their individual public keys $\{PK_i\}$ into
    a joint one $aPK_n$, which is needed to sign the \textit{Batch Applying Transactions} with the external events\
    (\textit{Inbound Value Transfers}, \textit{Outbound Value Transfers}, \textit{Boxes Eliminations}).

    \item \textbf{Committee transition}.
    Nodes in the $\mathbf{C}_i^{n-1}$ publish cross-chain message ${M_n : (aPK_n, \sigma_{n-1})}$ , where $aPK_n$ is\
    an aggregated public key of the new committee $\mathbf{C}_i^n$ , $\sigma_{n-1}$ is an aggregated signature of
    $M_n$ such that ${Verify(\sigma_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1}, Mn) = 1}$.
    Vaults are updated such that ${Vault\{(e_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1})\} \coloneqq(e_n, aPK_n)}$.

    \item \textbf{Chain extension}.
    \begin{legal}

        \item Every online consensus group member collects en existed chains related to the $L^+$ and verifying that for every chain every block,\
        produced up to $R^+$ blocks before contains correct data about the corresponding slot $sl'$ leader $PK'$.
        To verify a valid slot leader, responses from the ${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$ and ${\mathcal{F}}_{L}$ with the relevant inputs must equal $1$. Leader $PK'$ must be also a member of the committee, legal at $sl'$, this is checked in the same way. All forks are resolved by the rules of the longest chain and the largest stake in the corresponding priority.

        \item During the epoch, for every slot $sl$ every committee $\mathbf{C}_i^n$ member $PK_i$ separately evaluates\
        ${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$ with his own input ${x = \eta_n || sl || \textbf{nonce}}$\, where \textbf{nonce} is an arbitrary predefined string.
        If successful ${\mathcal{F}}_{L}$ returns $1$, then $PK_i$ is the slot $sl$ leader he evaluates ${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$ one more time with the input ${x' = \eta_n || sl || \textbf{test}}$, where \textbf{test} is another arbitrary predefined string.
        The associated proofs $\pi_i$ and $\rho_i$ will be included in the block, which will be added to the $L^+$.

        \textbf{Note:} The ${\mathcal{F}}_{VRF}$ is designed in such a way that not every slot has a leader,\
        moreover, most of the slots remain empty to serve protocol synchronization.
        If there are $P$ several elected leaders for this slot, they all can add new blocks
        $\{B_p\}_{p=0}^P$ with included proofs ${(v_i^{vrf}, \pi_i, \rho_i)}$.

        \item All committee $\mathbf{C}_i^n$ members observe events in their local chains $c_i$ and in the $L+$ mempool.
        If $PK_i$ is a slot $sl$ leader, then he is able to propose a batch $B^i_j$ of events from $c_i$ in a form of the \textit{Batch Applying Transaction}, which should be notarized by other members of the $\mathbf{C}_i^n$ with an aggregated signature.

        \item Notarized batch $B^i*_j$ can first of all be formed by any member of the $\mathbf{C}_i^n$.
        He should immediately send it to the leader, who proposed it and to the members of other committees $\mathbf{C}_{j\neq i}^n$.
        After the leader receives set of batches ${B^k*_j}$, he forms the block $\mathbf{B}_m$ with updates from the $L^+$ mempool included, sign it with ${\mathcal{F}}_{KES}$, includes all proofs and broadcasts it to all committees.

        \item After $R^+$ reliable slots number has passed all members of all committees that participated in the formation of the block $\mathbf{B}_m$ receive rewards proportional to their status.
    \end{legal}
