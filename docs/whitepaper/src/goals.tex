To overcome the described problems of the existing solutions, the resulted Spectrum protocol must satisfy\
the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Decentralization.} The system should be highly decentralized.
    \item \textbf{Interoperability.} The system should be able to support a large number of heterogeneous blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Openness.} The system should allow anyone to participate in consensus permissionlessly.
    Protocol should be fully open-source and all participants should be encouraged by the incentives system.
    \item \textbf{Consensus Scalability.} The system should be able to operate normally while maintaining\
    sufficiently large consensus groups consisting of hundreds of active validators on each connected blockchain.
    \item \textbf{Operational Scalability.} The system should scale linearly with the number of supported blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Security.} The system should be able to withstand Sybil attacks.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability.} The system should be able to tolerate faults of particular connected blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Upgradability.} The system should allow to add new blockchains into list of supported over time.
\end{enumerate}
