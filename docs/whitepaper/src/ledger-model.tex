Spectrum's global state includes a pool of value carrying units called \enquote{cells}.
A \enquote{Cell} encodes monetary value (e.g., fungible or non-fungible tokens) travelling inside the system and across its boards.

\begin{tabular}{ r l }
    TxId =   & H(Tx)            \\
    CellId = & H(TxId \times I) \\
\end{tabular}

Each cell has a unique stable identifier derived from ID of the transaction that produced the cell and its index in transaction outputs.

We distinguish two essential types of cells depending on the state of the value they encode.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Active
    \enquote{Active} value trvelling inside the system.
    An Active Cell can be modified while preserving its original stable identifier.
    This opens the door for more smooth management of shared cells (e.g., stablecoin bank or liquidity pool).

    \item Terminal
    Value to be exported into an external system.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Authenticators, Addresses and Ownership}\label{sec:authenticators-and-addresses}

\begin{tabular}{ r l }
    Authenticator = & ProveDlog \uplus Script \\
    Address =       & H(Authenticator)        \\
\end{tabular}

Each active cell has an exclusive owner identified by an address.
Address is derived from an authenticatior by applying collision resistant hash function to it.
To prove ownership of a cell a party must supply an authenticatior whose hash matches the owning address.
An authenticator can either be a public key or a script.
Once authenticated an owner can fleely move value locked withing the cell by either mutation or elimination of it.
