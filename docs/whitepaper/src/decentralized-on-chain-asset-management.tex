In order to lift on-chain assets to cross-chain level Spectrum has to take control over them.
Thus, all assets that Spectrum operates on are stored in on-chain \emph{vaults} which are ruled by the consensus.

Each vault stores epoch number $n$, an aggregated public key $\alpha{PK_n}$ of the current validator set $V_n$ and
is guarded with a smart-contract capable of performing verification of
an aggregated signature $\sigma_n$ ${verify: (\sigma_n, m_n, \alpha{PK_n}) \rightarrow 0 | 1}$.

\subsubsection{Rotating Authorized Committees in Vaults}

As explained before, committees in Spectrum are constantly rotated.
Thus, vaults have to be updated accordingly.
The transition is performed with the help of \enquote{retiring} committee, that must call ${changeEpoch: (\sigma_n, \alpha{PK_{n+1}})}$ on the vault contract, where $\alpha{PK_{n+1}}$ is the aggregated public key of the next commitee.
