Spectrum network is complex since it works with multiple connected blockchains.
In order to accurately describe and verify all the necessary properties of the Spectrum ledger, we should agree on the\
semantics and introduce data types that satisfy some validity conditions which we will describe in this section.

\subsubsection{Model formalization}
We will start with a semantics needed to describe our system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State}: the underlying data type of the Spectrum ledger, the validity of which must be proven.

    \item \textbf{Local state}: auxiliary data type describing the state on one of the connected chains.

    \item \textbf{Transition}: the means by which system is moved from one valid \textit{state} to another valid\
    \textit{state} or from one valid \textit{local state} to another valid \textit{local state}.

    \item \textbf{Signal}: the means by which \textit{transitions} are triggered.

    \item \textbf{Rule}: algorithm that describes how to derive a valid \textit{states},\
    \textit{local states} or \textit{transitions}.The rule has an \textit{antecedent}\
    (sometimes called \textit{premise}) and a
    \textit{consequent} (sometimes called \textit{conclusion}), such that if the
    conditions in the antecedent hold, the consequent is assumed to be a valid
    \textit{state}, \textit{local state} or \textit{transition}.

    \item \textbf{Environment}: sometimes network may implicitly rely on some additional information being present\
    in the system to evaluate the \textit{rules}.
    An environment does not have to exist (or, equivalently, we may have an empty environment), but crucially\
    an environment is not modified by \textit{transitions}.
\end{itemize}

The whole set of the above concepts forms a state transition system ${\Psi = (S, L, T, \Sigma, R, E)}$,\
where $S$ is a set of \textit{states}, $L$ is a set of \textit{local states}, $T$ is a set of \textit{transitions},\
$\Sigma$ is a set of \textit{signals}, $R$ is a set of \textit{rules} and $E$ is a set of \textit{environment} values.
