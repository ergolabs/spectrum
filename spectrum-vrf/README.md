# ECVRF

The Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function is a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) that
satisfies the trusted uniqueness, trusted collision resistance, and full pseudorandomness properties. The security
of this ECVRF follows from the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption in the random oracle model.
